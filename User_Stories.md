### I want to exchange contact information at an in person event:


### I want to be able to broadcast my contact information and intent to network at an in person event:
- Utilize Bluetooth and NFC hooks available on cell phones to ping localized notifications


### I want to exchange contact information with someone I've met digitally (virtual networking event):
- Utilize QR codes and short links to be able to send a easy to follow link to a user's personalized networking page

### I want to have multiple profiles I can use in different situations:
- Utilizing UI design, users can swipe between different profiles and lock to a specific profile for quick access. Profiles are only interconnected from the owner's perspective. A public viewer can not see the user's other profiles.


### I want to automate the process of connecting with someone over their various social media platforms (i.e. LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram)


### I want to be able to include the latest version of my resume when I exchange information and also use different resumes depending on who I'm talking to
